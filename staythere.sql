(1, 'Atomic Habits: Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results', 'Master the Little Things, Achieve the Big Ones', 'Atomic Habits is a book by James Clear that introduces a framework for building better habits and breaking bad ones. Clear argues that small, incremental changes can lead to big results over time, and that the key to success is to make small changes that are easy to stick with.\r\n\r\nThe book is divided into three parts:\r\n\r\nPart 1: Fundamentals: This part introduces the basic concepts of habit formation, such as the habit loop, the four laws of behavior change, and the identity equation.\r\nPart 2: Habits of Highly Effective People: This part focuses on specific habits that can help you achieve your goals, such as the two-minute rule, the habit stacking technique, and the temptation bundling technique.\r\nPart 3: Advanced Tactics: This part discusses more advanced techniques for habit formation, such as using habit scorecards and habit contracts.\r\nHere is a summary of some of the key takeaways from the book:\r\n\r\nHabits are the compound interest of self-improvement: Small, incremental changes can lead to big results over time.\r\nThe key to success is to make small changes that are easy to stick with: Don\'t try to change everything at once. Start by making one small change, and then build on that success.\r\nYour identity shapes your habits: The habits you form are shaped by your identity, which is your belief about who you are. To change your habits, you need to change your identity.', 'post-bg.jpg', '2023-11-04 17:58:52', 'first-post'),

The effect of freedom can be appreciated by considering the evolution of economic obligations. When someone is a slave, their whole person is subject to the master. The peasant has more freedom, but if they are to provide the lord with payments in kind, such as wheat or cattle, they must produce exactly the item required, or barter it at a great loss or inconvenience. But when the obligation takes a monetary form, the peasant is free as to whether to grow wheat, or keep cattle, or engage in other activities, as long as they pay the required tax.', 'post-bg.jpg', '2023-09-26 21:22:25', 'fourth-slug'),
